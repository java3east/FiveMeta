# FiveMeata

## Description
The objective of this resource is easier resource development, by providing meta files which can be used together with the LLS (Lua Language Server) to provide better intellisense and code completion.

## Features
- basic support for fxmanifest
- support for some native functions
- support for basic types (only for type savety, they are all based on default lua types)
- support for oxmysql

## Installation
To use the metafiles contained within this resource, do the following:
1. install the [LUA](vscode:extension/sumneko.lua) vs-code extension
2. put the downloaded files into your working directory
3. have fun with intellisense :D

## Contributing
This project relies on contribution, since there are way to many natives to implement for just one person. So if you have a native that is not yet registered, please add it to the meta file and open a merge request on this repository. The same thing goes for not yet implemented libraries.
